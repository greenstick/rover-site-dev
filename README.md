## Overview

I developed this project while working at Column Five Media in 2014 for our client, A24 Films with the assistance of Danny Miede (Timeline Interactive) and Chad Giacopelli. The website is especially content rich, featuring two interactive experiences, videos, an image gallery, and a scrolling directors statement. The splash panel of the website greets the user with an expansive desert view, made dynamic by a compelling horizontal parallax functionality steered by the user's mouse movement. To the top left is a custom menu which, upon clicking a link, scrolls the page to the selected content. Alternatively, a simple mouse scroll activates a sticky-scroll navigation feature, which brings into focus each content panel. The website is fully responsive, and leverages media queries to hide the full-screen interactives from users on smaller devices.
